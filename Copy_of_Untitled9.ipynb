        "#1. Code Reusability: function allows you to encapsulate a specific piece of logic or functionality into a reusable block of code. Instead of repeating the same code multiple times throughout your program,you can write a function onces and call it whenever you need that particular functionality.This promotes code resuse reduce duplication and makes our code more concise and easier to maintain.\n",
        "#2.Modularity and Abstraction: function prompts modularity by breaking down complex problem into smaller more manegeable tasks Each function can be designed to perform a specific task or set of realated tasks making it easier to understand test and debug individual component of your cod ethis abstraction also allows you to hide implementation details and expose only the neceesary interface,making your code more organized and easier to work\n",

        "In Python, polymorphism is supported through duck typing, which follows the principle of \"if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.\" This means that Python determines the compatibility of objects based on their behavior rather than their type or class hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, Python supports polymorphism with duck typing by allowing objects to be treated uniformly if they implement the same methods or behavior, regardless of their explicit type or class. This promotes code flexibility and encourages the use of common interfaces, leading to more concise and adaptable code."

This hides the implementation details of the class from the outside world and allows controlled access to the internal state of objects.\n",

        "1. Using double underscores (`__`) to define private attributes and methods.\n",

        "Yes, encapsulation can be bypassed in Python using several techniques, although they go against the principles of encapsulation and are generally considered bad practice. Here's how encapsulation can be bypassed:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Accessing Private Attributes and Methods:** Although private attributes and methods are intended to be inaccessible from outside the class, they can still be accessed directly by name mangling. Python allows access to private attributes and methods using their mangled names (e.g., `_ClassName__private_attribute`).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Using Reflection:** Python's reflection capabilities allow access to private attributes and methods using functions such as `getattr()` and `setattr()`. These functions can access and modify private attributes and methods by name.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Using Descriptors:** Python descriptors, such as properties, can be used to define custom behavior for attribute access. While properties can enforce encapsulation by controlling access to attributes, they can also be used to bypass encapsulation by providing unrestricted access to private attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, while encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming in Python, it can be bypassed using techniques like name mangling, reflection, and descriptors. However, such practices should be avoided as they violate the intended encapsulation of class implementations and can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and understand."
